Our immersive course teaches students about iOS mobile development. This field is constantly evolving, and it would be impossible to cover every tool in one course.

Instead, General Assembly provides a core set of objectives for this course, along with guidelines for how to ensure students reach these objectives. As an instructor, you have the opportunity and responsibility to adapt these recommendations to your local context and modify/expand on any of these tools as you see fit.

## Required Tools for Students

- A Mac laptop (*required*) and an iOS device for testing (*optional*).
- Upgrade laptop OS to the latest version, as needed.
- Download and install the latest version of [Xcode](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/).


#### Optional Tools
These tools aren't required, but offer additional functionality that students may find helpful!

- Popular Text Editors: [Atom](https://atom.io) or [Sublime](http://www.sublimetext.com)


## Technology Policy

General Assembly introduces students to concepts using the environment, tools, and ethics of the open-source community. We try to only use languages and tools that are open-source and free for commercial use.

#### Laptop Policy

Due to the necessary tools used in the iOS environment, **Macs are required** for this course. We strongly suggest that students bring laptops with screens of *at least 13-inches*. Having an 11-inch (or smaller) screen has been shown to adversely affect student performance.

#### Operating Systems Policy

**Mac:** In order to run the latest version of Xcode, student laptops should be using the most recent OS X 10.11.4 (currently, "El Capitan"). Students will need update their OS before starting the course.

Please note: *This rules out the use of some older MacBooks*
